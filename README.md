I have developed a Contacts Manager app, that demonstrates some of my knowledge in Android development. 
The app utilizes a Room Database with DAO, ViewModel, and Repository patterns for efficient data handling, 
RecyclerView integration with swipe-to-delete functionality, data binding for streamlined UI updates, 
and Toast messages for user feedback.
